# School_District_Analysis
# Project Overview:

A City School Board has asked the data analyst to analyze the school’s performance based on the student standardized test score and student funding by the school.  The report should also cover the analysis based on the following categories:
1.	Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
2.	The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.
3.	The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
4.	School performance based on the budget per student
5.	School performance based on the school size.
6.	School performance based on the type of school.
